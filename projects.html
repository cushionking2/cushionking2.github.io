		<h1>Notes</h1>
		
		<h3>XHTML & CSS</h3>
		XHTML and CSS are the code standards that make websites work. You can view the code behind any website by
		right clicking in the window and selecting "view source". Although the code you see looks a bit complicated at
		first, it will be easy once you understand how XHTML works. 
		
		<h4>Editors</h4>
    Much like Python, websites at their most basic level are just text files. For web programming, your compiler
    is a web browser, so all you need in order to write a website is a simple text editor.
		
		<h3>&lt;Tags&gt;</h3>
    The language of XHTML revolves around tags. Every component in a website is contained within a tag. The first
    tag you create on a website declares the doctype, or the type of file your document will be. 
		
		<h4>Scope</h4>
    Most tags have opening and closing tags. Everything in a web object is contained within the opening and
    closing tags. 
		
		<h4>&lt;Head&gt;</h4>
    The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user
    of the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website, browser information etc.Below
    we will create a header of our own for our new website. 
		
		<h4>&lt;Body&gt;</h4>
    The body of the site includes all of the actual site content, including paragraphs, images, audio, animations
    backgrounds, and so on.

		
		<h4>Paragraphs &lt;p&gt;</h4>
		HTML is not sensitive to white space, so spaces, tabs, and returns in your code do not translate into text on the page.
		The browser looks at your text as in one long line of code.
		&lt;p&gt; (and its closing tag) are used to enclose a paragraph of text on a new line.
		
		<h4>Inline Text Tags</h4>
		These tags are used to modify or display text.
		Line Break and Horizontal Rule do not have opening or closing tags, but ones that change text apearance do.
		
		<h5>Line Breaks &lt;br/&gt;</h5>
		Instead of using new &lt;p&gt; to separate paragraphs, &lt;br/&gt; can be used to create a new line and separate text.
		
		<h5>Horizontal Rule &lt;hr&gt;</h5>
		Similar to &lt;br/&gt;, it adds a horizontal line instead of a new line.
		
		<h5>&lt;strong&gt;</h5>
		Makes the enclosed text bold.
		
		<h5>&lt;em&gt;</h5>
		Makes the enclosed text italicized.
		
		<h4>Comments</h4>
		Comments in code can be added using the format: &lt;!-- Comment Text --&gt;
		
		<h4>Links</h4>
		Links can be added to a webpage using the &lt;a&gt; tag.<br/>
		
		<h4>Headers</h4>
		Header tags &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; are used to enclose headers in decreasing font size.
		
		<h4>Page Navigation with Links</h4>
		You can create links that go to separate parts of the page by naming your sections.<br/>
		
		<h4>Adding Images to Your Site</h4>
		Images can be used and adjusted on your site using tags and attributes.
		The height and width attributes can be used to adjust image size.
		Either pixels or page ratio can be used to specify.<br/>
		
		<h4>Tool Tips</h4>
		Tool tips allow the user to hover over elements of a page for further explanation of what they do.<br/><br/>
